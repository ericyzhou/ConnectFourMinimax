# Connect Four

Connect Four but instead of a 7x6 it's 4x4 because the minimax algorithm takes too long on anything bigger.
Uses alpha-beta pruning to reduce the processing time down to ~5 seconds at move 1.

3 different controllers:

ConnectFourController- Human vs Human

ConnectFourAIController- Human vs AI

ConnectFourAIAIController- AI vs AI
